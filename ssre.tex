\begin{abstract}
    A Man-in-the-Middle(MITM) attack is a type of cyberattack where an attacker
    secretly relays and possibility alters the communication between 2 
    unsuspecting parties.
    Most recent cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint 
    authentication specifically to prevent MITM attacks. 
    
    The goal of this project is to demonstrate, using scapy, why such 
    measurements are needed.
    Scapy is a python module that enables a user to send, sniff and forge 
    network packets, as such it provides easy methods to the types of 
    functionalities needed to run a MITM attack.
    
    4 different protocols were analyzed (FTP, SNMP, Telnet and SMTP).
