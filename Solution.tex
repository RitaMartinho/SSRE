\section{Solution}

The final product of this projects accomplishes the 1st step mentioned on 
\ref{sec:Intro} through a \textit{ping broadcast} command, identifying all 
available hosts present in the 
network.
It then positions itself using \textit{ARP spoofing}, communicating to both 
users that the IP to which they intend to communicate with belongs to it's MAC 
address. 
Finally, it preforms 1 type of exploitation (active and passive), depending on
the service being used.

Given the nature of MITM attacks, an emphasis is given to the continuous 
forwarding of packets between both victims, as to not alert the users that the 
communication has been compromised.
This usually requires a fast forwarding process to simulate a normal traffic 
flow. 

The proposed final system overcomes this difficulty using the Linux 
IP forwarding mechanism and deactivating ICMP redirecting in the attacker machine.

\subsection{FTP Passive Attack}

Using the built-in Scapy's \textit{sniff} function,
