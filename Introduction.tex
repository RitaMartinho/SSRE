\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
This paper will focus on the work developed for the main project of the 
Security for Systems and Networks course.

This projects aims to demonstrate the different procedures used to carry out a 
MITM attack and their potential outcomes.

3 Linux Virtual Machines (VM) were used, 2 simulating normal users of the 
analyzed protocols - victims - and 1 running scapy, simulating the potential 
attacker.

The general flow of a MITM attack is as follows: \textbf{Sniffing/Evesdropping}
- the attacker detects some kind of communication or vulnerable victims - 
\textbf{Positioning} - the attacker position itself between both victims -
\textbf{Exploitation} - the attacker stores or even alters the collected 
information for nefarious actions.
